615 Midterm Project 
Clean the Dataset


Here a short outline of my midterm project:

My Midterm project consists of 14 files:

1 Midterm Project Outline in txt

2 files of original dataset (oilgascounty.CSV, oilgascounty.xlsx)download straightly from Data Government

1 file of Final_clean_data_set that walks you step by step how I made data tidy 

1 file of Titydata that I saved as Tidydata.CSV as a result of data cleaning

1 file of TidyData Visualization that provide graphics and data exploration built upon Tidydata.csv

6 sample files that break down from TidyData Visualization. This is an perfect opportunity if you wanna copy the code and follow along. 

1 Final R Markdown File that combines everything together as a written presentation.

1 PDF of Final Report


Please note that my teammate is Vevian, and we have worked consistently on this project. I really appreciate her unique insights and contribution. The entire project would have not progressed this far without her dedication.
